In Dictionary's development, VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router) architecture is being used for these key reasons:

- **Better Maintainability:**  VIPER ensures a clear division between presentation logic, business logic, and app navigation, making the codebase easier to manage and update as the application grows.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Separating business logic from UI components allows for more effective unit testing. Developers can concentrate on testing the interactor and presenter logic without being concerned about the user interface.
- **Increased Modularity:** VIPER promotes modularity by dividing concerns into separate layers, leading to a more organized and efficient development process.
